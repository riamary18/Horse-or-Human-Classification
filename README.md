# Horse-or-Human-Classification
The objective of this project is to distinguish between images of horses and humans generated by a machine. The dataset is stored on Google Cloud Storage, and TensorFlow and Keras are employed to build the model. Additionally, the matplotlib library is utilized to visualize the results of the intermediate layers of the model. Users have the option to upload their own images and obtain the corresponding model outputs in this interactive project.
